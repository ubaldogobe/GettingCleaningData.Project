# GettingCleaningData.Project

## 1. Unzip the source into your local drive (link: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). It generate a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" with all datasets.

# 2. Define this new folder as working directory in RStudio (use setwd())

# 3. Save run_analysis.R into this folder

# 4. Run: source("run_analysis.R")

# 5. Use data <- read.table("dataset_with__averages.txt") to read the data. It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus "for each activity and each subject" means 30 * 6 = 180 rows
